# If you did not install PyBlosxom as a library (i.e. python setup.py install)

# Blog configuration
# ==================

# What is the locale for this blog?  This is used when formatting dates
# and other locale-sensitive things.  Make sure the locale is valid for
# your system.  See the PyBlosxom documentation for details.
#py["locale"] = "en_US.iso-8859-1"
#py["locale"] = "ja_JP.UTF-8"

# What is the title of this blog?
py["blog_title"] = "holymachine"

# What is the description of this blog?
py["blog_description"] = "Tech, and something foo bar"

# Who are the author(s) of this blog?
py["blog_author"] = "hylom"

# What is the email address through which readers of the blog may contact
# the authors?
py["blog_email"] = "hylomm at gmail.com"

# What is this blog's primary language (for outgoing RSS feed)?
py["blog_language"] = "ja"

# Encoding for output.  This defaults to iso-8859-1.
py["blog_encoding"] = "utf-8"


# These are the rights you give to others in regards to the content
# on your blog.  Generally, this is the copyright information.
# This is used in the Atom feeds.  Leaving this blank or not filling
# it in correctly could result in a feed that doesn't validate.
py["blog_rights"] = "Copyright 2008 hylom"

# Where is this blog geographically located?  This is used by geocoding 
# (aka geotagging crawlers) and sites like http://geourl.org/ .

# Where are this blog's entries kept?
py["datadir"] = "/Users/hylom/Sites/pyblosxom/entries"

# List of strings with directories that should be ignored (e.g. "CVS")
# ex: py['ignore_directories'] = ["CVS", "temp"]
py["ignore_directories"] = ["CVS"]

# Should I stick only to the datadir for items or travel down the directory
# hierarchy looking for items?  If so, to what depth?
# 0 = infinite depth (aka grab everything)
# 1 = datadir only
# n = n levels down
py["depth"] = 0

# How many entries should I show on the home page and category pages?
# If you put 0 here, then I will show all pages.

# Logging configuration
# =====================

# Where should PyBlosxom write logged messages to?
# If set to "NONE" log messages are silently ignored.
# Falls back to sys.stderr if the file can't be opened for writing.
#py["log_file"] = "/path/to/pyblosxom.log"

# At what level should we log to log_file?
# One of: "critical", "error", "warning", "info", "debug"
# For production, "warning" or "error' is recommended.
#py["log_level"] = "warning"

# This lets you specify which channels should be logged.
# If specified, only messages from the listed channels are logged.
# Each plugin logs to it's own channel, therefor channelname == pluginname.
# Application level messages are logged to a channel named "root".
# If you use log_filter and ommit the "root" channel here, app level messages 
# are not logged! log_filter is mainly interesting to debug a specific plugin.
#py["log_filter"] = ["root", "plugin1", "plugin2"]


# ======================
# Optional Configuration
# ======================

# What should this blog use as its base url?
#py["base_url"] = "http://www.some.host/weblog"

# Default parser/preformatter. Defaults to plain (does nothing)
#py["parser"] = "plain"



# Plugin configuration
# ====================

# Plugin directories:
# You can now specify where you plugins all lives, there are two types
# of plugindirectories, the standard pyblosxom plugins, and the xmlrpc
# plugins.  You can list out as many directories you want, but they
# should only contain the related plugins.
# Example: py['plugin_dirs'] = ["/opt", "/usr/bin"]
py["plugin_dirs"] = ["/Users/hylom/Sites/pyblosxom/plugins"]

# There are two ways for PyBlosxom to load plugins.  The first is the
# default way which involves loading all the plugins in the lib/plugins
# directory in alphanumeric order.  The second is by specifying a
# "load_plugins" key here.  Doing so will cause us to load only the
# plugins you name and we will load them in the order you name them.
# The "load_plugins" key is a list of strings where each string is
# the name of a plugin module (i.e. the filename without the .py at
# the end).
# ex: py["load_plugins"] = ["pycalendar", "pyfortune", "pyarchives"]
py["load_plugins"] = ["pycalendar"]



# Caching configuration
# =====================

# Using Caching? Caching speeds up rendering the page that is going to be
# shown. Even if you are not using pyblosxom special features, caching can
# improve rendering speed of certain flavours that can show a large number of
# files at one time. Choose a cache mechanism you'd like, see the
# Pyblosxom/cache/ directory, and read the source on how to enable caching with
# the particular cache driver, you need to set two variables:
#py["cacheDriver"] = "xxxx"
#py["cacheConfig"] = ""



# Static rendering
# ================

# Doing static rendering?  Static rendering essentially "compiles" your
# blog into a series of static html pages.  For more details, read:
# http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/1.3.1/manual/c797.html
# 
# What directory do you want your static html pages to go into?
#py["static_dir"] = "/path/to/static/dir"

# What flavours should get generated?
#py["static_flavours"] = ["html"]

# What other paths should we statically render?
# This is for additional urls handled by other plugins like the booklist
# and plugin_info plugins.  If there are multiple flavours you want
# to capture, specify each:
# ex: py["static_urls"] = ["/booklist.rss", "/booklist.html"]
#py["static_urls"] = ["/path/to/url1", "/path/to/url2"]

# Whether (1) or not (0) you want to create date indexes using month
# names?  (ex. /2004/Apr/01)  Defaults to 1 (yes).
#py["static_monthnames"] = 1

# Whether (1) or not (0) you want to create date indexes using month
# numbers?  (ex. /2004/04/01)  Defaults to 0 (no).
#py["static_monthnumbers"] = 0

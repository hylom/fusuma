Summary
=======

Syndicating your blog is very important as it provides a mechanism
for readers of your blog to keep up to date.  Typically this is done
with newsreader software.  Additionally, there are web-sites that post
blog entries from a variety of blogs that have similar content.  Both
newsreaders and planet-type web-sites need a semantically marked up
version of your blog.

Most newsreaders read most of the syndication formats.  So you shouldn't
feel that you have to implement each one of them in your blog--you can most
assuredly get away with implementing RSS 2.0 or Atom 1.0 and be just fine.

The syndication flavours that come with PyBlosxom should be fine for most
blogs.  When pointing people to your syndication feed, just use one
of the syndication flavours:

* ``http://your-server/path-to-blog/index.rss``
* ``http://your-server/path-to-blog/index.rss20``
* ``http://your-server/path-to-blog/index.atom``



Feed formats that come with PyBlosxom
=====================================

PyBlosxom comes with a few default flavours, three of which are feed
formats.


RSS 0.9.1
---------

PyBlosxom comes with an rss flavour that produces RSS 0.9.1 output.  Here's
a sample of what it produces::

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <!-- name="generator" content="pyblosxom/1.2 3/25/2005" -->
   <!DOCTYPE rss PUBLIC "-//Netscape Communications//DTD RSS 0.91//EN"
   "http://my.netscape.com/publish/formats/rss-0.91.dtd">

   <rss version="0.91">
   <channel>
   <title>My Blog</title>
   <link>http://www.joe.com/blog/index.rss</link>
   <description>This is my blog about trivial things</description>
   <language>en</language>
   <item>
       <title>Example of an entry post</title>

       <link>http://www.joe.com/blog/entries/example1.html</link>
       <description>&lt;p&gt;
     Here's an example of an entry in my blog.  This is the body of the entry.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   </description>
     </item>
   </channel>
   </rss>


This example only has one entry in it.  The number of entries the rss flavour
will display is determined by the ``num_entries` property in your 
``config.py`` file.

.. Note::

   Probably better not to use RSS 0.9.1:

   RSS 0.9.1 format lacks dates in the data for the items.  Unless you 
   include the date for the entry somewhere in the description block, people 
   looking at your RSS 0.9.1 feed won't know what the date the entry was 
   created on was.
 
   Unless you have some reason to use RSS 0.9.1 as your syndication format,
   you should look at using RSS 2.0 or Atom 1.0 both of which also come
   with PyBlosxom.


For more information, look at the `RSS 0.9.1 spec`_.

RSS 2.0
-------

PyBlosxom 1.3 comes with an RSS 2.0 flavour called "rss20".  If it's missing
features that you want (for example, some folks are doing podcasting with
their blog), then override the individual templates you need to adjust.

For more information on RSS 2.0, see the `RSS 2.0 spec`_.

Atom 1.0
--------

PyBlosxom 1.3 comes with an Atom 1.0 flavour called "atom".  If it's
missing features that you want, then override the individual templates
you need to adjust.

For more information on Atom 1.0, see the `Atom 1.0 spec`_.

Debugging your feeds
====================

`FeedValidator`_ is a hugely useful tool for figuring out whether your
feed is valid and fixing bugs in your feed content.

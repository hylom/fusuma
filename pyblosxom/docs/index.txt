Introduction
============

The manual pages in this directory will cover all aspects of using
and developing for PyBlosxom.  

It is a work in progress.



Mission, What's Missing, and Helping Out
========================================

The mission of this manual is to cover all aspects of using and
developing for `Pyblosxom`_. It is very much a work in
progress. However, we do promise that the manual will get better over
time.

.. _Pyblosxom: http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/

This manual will always be free.  It's licensed under the MIT License
along with the rest of PyBlosxom.  The manual is version controlled along 
with the rest of PyBlosxom in the SVN repository at SourceForge.  That's a 
boon because everyone can see the `current state`_.

.. _current state: http://pyblosxom.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pyblosxom/trunk/pyblosxom/docs/

There's no list of what's missing, however, there are a series of
FIXMEs placed around the document with some details as to what needs
to be provided and/or fixed.  I'm sure there are things missing that
have been completely overlooked as well.  This can change if someone
wants to organize a list of missing topics (which would then probably
cause a reorganization of the manual to account for those topics).

If you want to help out with documentation, let us know on the
`pyblosxom-devel`_ mailing list.  If you notice errors, missing
pieces, sections that are unclear, examples that are erroneous, or
anything else, `let us know`_.

.. _pyblosxom-devel: http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pyblosxom-devel
.. _let us know: mailto:pyblosxom-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

Details of mailing lists and other contact information are on our
web-site at http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/.

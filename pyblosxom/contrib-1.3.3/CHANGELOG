Changes between contributed pack 1.3.2 and 1.3.3
================================================

comments

 * fix a showstopper bug from the 1.3.2 release: don't render duplicate
   comments in the course of populating template vars.

 * avoid sending unnecessary params in ajax requests.

 * make check_javascript more fault-tolerant to missing params.

Changes between contributed pack 1.3.1 and 1.3.2
================================================

General

 * reorganized directory structure.

pycalendar

 * fixed to be locale aware and also added a config property for specifying
   which day to use as the first day of the week.  (Thanks Martin!)

weblogsping

 * fixed the plugin to handle error conditions.  (Thanks Ryan!)

comments

 * handle UTF-8 encoded text correctly. (Thanks makoshark!)

 * add $cmt_optionally_linked_author template variable.

 * add support for sending comment email notifications via a local MTA,
   using the comment_mta_cmd config variable, instead of SMTP.

 * add a simple new JavaScript-based anti-spam plugin, check_javascript.py.

 * add the Akismet anti-spam filter, akismetcomments.py. (Thanks Mako and
   Blake Winton!)

 * add support for AJAX comments.

 * added nofollow support to $cmt_optionally_linked_author. (Thanks, Todd
   Warner, for the ping!)

 * updated RSS template and code to support RSS feeds for comments on
   individual posts. An RSS feed for all comments, site-wide, is yet to come.

trackback and xmlrpc_pingback

 * these are no longer subjected to comment_reject filtering plugins. a new
   callback, trackback_reject, has been added for filtering trackbacks.
   (Thanks Junji Nakanishi!)

moinmoin

 * now compatible with MoinMoin 1.5 as well as 1.0. (Thanks Zarick Lau!)

editfile

 * fixed to search the environment for editors.  (Thanks Mako!)


Changes between contributed pack 1.3 and 1.3.1
==============================================

rst

 * fixed two bugs that prevented the plugin from working.  (Thanks g2boojum!)


Changes between contributed pack 1.2.2 and 1.3
==============================================

General

 * Added release dates to CHANGELOG.txt file.

 * Fixed all logging to use the new functions in PyBlosxom 1.3.

comments

 * Adjusted the behavior so that comments are shown if "showcomments=yes" 
   is in the querystring or if the pyblosxom request is for a specific 
   blog entry (as opposed to a category with only one blog entry in it).  
   In doing this, I moved the code from cb_pathinfo to cb_prepare. 
   (Thanks to Matt Weber for the idea!)
     
 * Removed the "showcomments=yes" from the comment-form html code.

 * Fixes to allow the comments plugin work with Python 2.2.  (Thanks
   Nathan!)

 * Adjusted the documentation text to make it clearer that the bit
   about what properties each entry needs to have applies only to
   developers.  Added __description__ and __url__ information.

 * Fixed issues with rendering.  Also removed the "if this is rss,
   then don't do stuff".

 * Fixed an issue where if the config.py file doesn't have blog_encoding
   set, the comments plugin would die.

 * Fixed a security problem where the url and author fields were not
   getting sanitized.  (Thanks Tung Wai Yip!)

 * Unfixed the url not getting sanitized--we already remove html from
   it and sanitize unnecessarily adds an <a href...> </a> to it.

 * Re-added the logging code that the comments plugin uses when things
   go sour.

 * Added SMTP-sanitization to the email field.  (Thanks David!)

 * Changed the comment reject callback so that rejection plugins can
   return 0 (the comment is fine), 1 (the comment is rejected) or
   a tuple of 1 and the error message as a string.

   For example:

      return 0
      return 1
      return (1, "This comment contains a blacklisted address.")

   (Thanks Steven!)

 * Changed the format of the body of the email that the comments plugin
   sends the blog owner to be more informational and readable.  
   (Thanks Alec!)

pycategories

 * Fixed a cosmetic issue where an extra / was getting added to the
   root url

 * Fixed a problem where the finish template was incorrectly pulling
   from the category_finish config property.  (Thanks Rob!)

 * Fixed a problem where the totals weren't being counted correctly.
   (Thanks Rob!)

 * Added "_urlencoded" versions of the category variables.  (Thanks
   Petteri!)

rst entryparser

 * Added two configurable options to the rst entryparser.  The first 
   sets the starting level for rendered heading elements.  The second 
   enables and disables the promotion of a lone top-level section title 
   to the document title.  (Thanks Jan-Wijbrand!)

 * Fixed the rst entryparser to handle metadata.  (Thanks to spanezz!)

xmlrpc_metaweblog

 * Fixed _getCategories so that it returns a list of dicts rather
   than a list of strings.  This conforms to the metaWeblogApi
   (http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi) and fixes the getCategories
   request.  (Thanks Rob!)

Changes between contributed pack 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 (21 June, 2005)
================================================================

General

 * New CHANGELOG.txt file which describes the changes between this version
   and the last as well as compatability and behavior issues.

 * New README.txt file which describes what's in the contributed plugins
   pack, where you can find it, and various other things about the contributed
   plugins pack.

genericwiki

 * Matej updated genericwiki so that it works as an entryparser as well as
   a preformatter.  Will fixed up the documentation.  genericwiki was moved
   from the preformatter directory to the entryparser directory.  
   (Thanks Matej!)

pycategories

 * Now has two new properites "category_start" which gets printed once before 
   printing the category list and "category_finish" which gets printed once 
   after printing the category list.  Additionally, the default values for 
   "category_begin" and "category_end" were fixed.  This makes the default 
   output for pycategories (x)html compliant.  (Thanks Joseph!)

comments

 * comments no longer shows comments by default!  In order to view comments
   for a given entry, you must append "showcomments=yes" to the querystring.
   THIS IS NOT A BACKWARDS-COMPATIBLE CHANGE!  (Thanks David!)

 * comments no longer has documentation for the unused comments-rejected-words
   property.

 * comments no longer requires the email field.

 * all the flavour templates for the comments plugin have been updated.

 * We cleaned up the comment error messages so they're useful to the user.
   (Thanks Nathaniel!)

w3cdate

 * w3cdate plugin now provides $w3cdate in head and foot templates.  It no
   longer requires PyXML.  (Thanks to Steven and Matej!)


Changes between contributed pack 1.2 and 1.2.1 (07 May, 2005)
=============================================================

 * bunch of fixes to comments and trackback plugins.

 * overhauled pycategories plugin (see documentation at top of file for more
   details).

 * added licensing information to files and updated some documentation.

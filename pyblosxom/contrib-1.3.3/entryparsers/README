Entryparsers manipulates files that are not standard text entry and will try to
render it as HTML if possible.

For example, a .csv file could be converted into a table automatically.
rtf->html conversions, or .doc -> html conversions.

To install entryparsers, just copy the files that handles a certain extension
into you Pyblosxom/plugins/ directory. Drop in a file with that particular
extension you like, like entering a normal blosxom entry, and hopefully, it'll
get rendered beautifully as HTML.

The files placed here are in the form of ext.py, where ext it the extension of
the file we expect to handle.

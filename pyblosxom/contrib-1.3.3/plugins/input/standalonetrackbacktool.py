This plugin replaces the legacy $tb in older pyblosxoms <= 0.6

Since there is a proper plugin for feedback, this is deprecated as it
uses the MovableType's Standalone Trackback Utility. Since I have no
idea how python can read perl's Storable data, to know if you've got a
trackback or not means $tb is either a '+' or a '-'.

Trackback data directory (If you install Standalone Trackback Tool) is
configured in your config.py this way::

    py['tb_data'] = '/path/to/tb_data/directory'

The Movabletype Standalone Trackback tool can be found at
http://www.movabletype.org/docs/tb-standalone.html This is useful for blosxom
users :)

Using this plugin:

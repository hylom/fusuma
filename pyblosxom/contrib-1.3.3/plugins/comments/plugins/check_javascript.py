A PyBlosxom comment spam plugin

This plugin filters spam with a dash of JavaScript on the client side. The
JavaScript sets a hidden input field "secretToken" in the comment form to the
blog's title. This plugin checks the secretToken URL parameter and rejects the
comment if it's not set correctly.

The benefit of JavaScript as an anti-spam technique is that it's very
successful. It has extremely low false positive and false negative rates, as
compared to conventional techniques like CAPTCHAs, bayesian filtering, and
keyword detection.

Of course, JavaScript has its own drawbacks, primarily that it's not supported
in extremely old browsers, and that users can turn it off. That's a very small
minority of cases, though. Its effectiveness as an anti-spam technique usually
make that tradeoff worthwhile.

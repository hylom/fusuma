Preformatter for people who are lazy to type <p>s, <br />s, and </p>

Let's face it, HTML is hard, and us non-html slaves do not need treatment that
HTML markups do to us.

This preformat plugin will help you with all the silly linebreaks markup and
convert them to either a <br /> for those one liners, or a <p> for those blank
lines.

You can configure this as your default preformatter by configuring it in your
L{config} file as follows::

    py['parser'] = 'linebreaks'

or in your blosxom entries, place a C{#parser wiki} line after the title of
your blog::

    My Little Blog Entry
    #parser linebreaks
    This is a text
    that will become

    properly tagged html for simple 
    linebreaks

Lucene plugin for pyblosxom

This code is based on Sam Ruby's code for blosxom <http://www.intertwingly.net/code>

To use this plugin, you need to put the bin directory somewhere where it can
be accessed by the lucene.py plugin.   In order for indexing to work, you'll
need a cronjob that runs bin/index.sh periodically.  Here's a sample crontab
entry that does just that:

0 * * * * $HOME/pyblog/bin/index.sh

Copy the lucene.py plugin into your plugins directory (be sure that defaultFileList.py is also installed

Be sure to edit the configuration variables in lucene.py

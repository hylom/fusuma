"""
Adds a 'w3cdate' variable to every entry which has the mtime of the entry
in ISO8601 format.

Adds a 'w3cdate' variable to the head and foot templates which has the mtime
of the first entry in the entrylist being displayed (this is often the
youngest/most-recent entry).


Note: When adding this plugin to the load_plugins list, it helps 
to put the plugin early in the list so that the data will be 
available to subsequent plugins.

Note: You might get better results if you have PyXMl installed as 
part of your Python installation.  If you don't, then we fudge the 
date using a home-brew function.


Thanks to Matej Cepl for the hacked iso8601 code that doesn't require
PyXML.

"""
This is my fancy module to add a token which tells us whether we're
the first day being displayed or not.

To install:
 1. Copy this file into your pyblosxom/Pyblosxom/plugins directory.

 2. Create a file named date_head.html in your datadir containing::

    <div class="$dayDivClass">
    <span class="blosxomDate">$date</span>

 3. Edit your config.py and add the line::

    py['firstDayDiv'] = 'blosxomFirstDayDiv'

 4. That's it.  You're done.

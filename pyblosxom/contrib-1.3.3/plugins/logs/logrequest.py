Standard logRequest plugin.

Drop this file in the Pyblosxom/plugins/ directory of pyblosxom, and in your
config.py (or your config INI file depending on your installation), create a
config entry called logfile and this will be the filename you want this
logRequest plugin to log to.

For example in config.py:
py['logfile'] = '/path/to/file'

or in the INI file:
logfile = /path/to/file

The resulting file will be file + the extension of .txt

If the filename is relative, then it will be written to where pyblosxom runs.
